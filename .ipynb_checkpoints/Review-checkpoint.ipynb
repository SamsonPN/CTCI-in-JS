    "## Linked Lists(LL):\n",
    "* a data structure that stores items in a linear fashion where each element has a pointer that points to the next element in the list\n",
    "    - this pointer (usually called next) can either point to the next node in the list or null\n",
    "* singly LL: contains only 1 pointer that points to the next item in the list\n",
    "* doubly LL: contains 2 pointers that points to the previous and next items in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Linked List? \n",
    "* linked lists were used to save on memory back when computers had limited space. this is because they only allocate what's needed for the elements. in some languages like C, we tell the computer how much space to reserve for an array. if it doesn't need all of the space it reserved, the space is still not usable by other programs\n",
    "* linked lists were also used when people didn't know how many elements were going to be in a list. instead of guessing how much space to allocate, linked lists could add or delete elements at will without all the guesswork\n",
    "* nowadays, we have dynamically sized arrays so the use of linked lists isn't as prevalent"
